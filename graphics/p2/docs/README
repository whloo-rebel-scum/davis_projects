ECS175, Project 2
__________________________________________________________
MANUAL:

TO COMPILE: run Makefile. The only cpp file needed is loo_wesley_p2.cpp.
MAC OSX users may need to uncomment an include in the cpp file, as well as the appropriate OpenGL flags in the Makefile.
NOTE: The -lGLEW flag was not included with the Linux compile flags because Fedora (my PC, not the CSIF) couldn't seem to find the correct libraries/files associated with the flag, even after installing everything it suggested.
The program seems to run fine without it.

TO RUN: ./whloo_p2 [object text file]

NOTES: Rendering the bunny_scene file is very slow. Other test files with a lot fewer points seems to run fine.

CONTROLS:

SELECTING OBJECTS:
Use the number keys 1-9 to select the corresponding objects to perform transformations on, as described in the object file.

FUNCTIONS: When the program first starts, the default function selected is TRANSLATE.
When the appropriate key is pressed, the command line will declare what function was chosen.

To TRANSLATE: press the 't' key.
The 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys correspond to moving up, left, down, right, respectively, on the x and y axis.
The 'q' and 'z' keys correspond to moving up and down respectively on the z-axis.

To ROTATE: press the 'r' key.
The 'a' and 'd' keys correspond to rotating the selected object counterclockwise and clockwise respectively about an arbitrary axis. The default axis is has the endpoints {0, 0.5, 0} and {1, 0.5, 0}.

To EDIT ROTATION PARAMETERS: press the 'e' key, when the ROTATE function is selected.
The console will first state the current rotation axis points and the current rotation angle.
It will then prompt you to enter the coordinates of two new points that will form another axis.
Afterwards, it will ask for a new rotation angle (in degrees).

To SCALE: press the 'g' key.
The 'w' and 's' keys correspond to scaling the object size up or down respectively.

To SAVE the scene: press the 'o' key.

To KILL the program: press the 'k' key.

To view a PROJECTION to either the XY, YZ, or XZ plane: press the 'p' key.
The command line will then prompt you to enter a 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to a specific plane projection.
